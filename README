Blink for Web
=============

Blink for web is a simple web frontend for making audio / video calls from a
web browser, using WebRTC technologies.

It's built using HTML and JavaScript and uses the SylkRTC API.


Development
-----------

Nodejs is needed for development. Versions >= 0.12 are recommended. A convenience
`configure` script and `Makefile` are provided.

# Install all dependencies
./configure

# Build the ready to be deployed distribution (available in dist/)
make

# Development build, starts a test webserver which auto-reloads as the code changes
make dev

# Clean the distribution
make clean

# Clean all installed packages and generated files
make distclean

# Deploy the built website to the server
make deploy

# Deploy the built website to the staging server
make deploy-test


Debugging
---------

By default Blink for Web doesn't output a lot of information to the browser's JavaScript console.
Console debug messages are namespaced by library, the two most important ones being 'sylkrtc' and 'blinkrtc'.
In order to enable debugging for both open the browser's JavaScript console and type the following:

window.blinkDebugger.enable('sylkrtc*,blinkrtc*');

Then reload the page. Debug messages will be logged to the console now.
